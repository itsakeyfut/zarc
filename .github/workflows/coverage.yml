          # Manual coverage tracking can be done through:
          # 1. Test file enumeration
          # 2. Function coverage analysis
          # 3. Integration with external tools like kcov (for compiled binaries)

            Test execution completed successfully.

            **Note:** Zig does not yet have built-in coverage tooling.
            Manual coverage tracking is documented in \`docs/implementation/TESTING_STRATEGY.md\`.

            **Phase 0 Target:** 70%+ coverage

            ### Coverage Goals by Layer:
            - Core: 90%+
            - Compression: 85%+
            - Formats: 85%+
            - I/O: 80%+
            - App: 75%+
            - CLI: 70%+

            For detailed coverage metrics, please review test files in \`tests/\`.
