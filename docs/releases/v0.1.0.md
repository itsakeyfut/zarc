# zarc v0.1.0 - Foundation Release

**Release Date**: October 23, 2025

We're excited to announce the first release of **zarc** - a modern, cross-platform archive tool written in Zig!

## What is zarc?

zarc (Zig Archive) is designed to solve the inconsistencies and security issues common in existing archive tools. It provides a unified interface across Windows, Linux, and macOS with consistent behavior and strong security guarantees.

## Key Features

### Archive Operations
- **Extract tar.gz archives** with a simple, intuitive command
- **List archive contents** with detailed file information
- **Test archive integrity** to verify file correctness
- **Pattern matching** to include or exclude specific files during extraction

### Cross-platform Excellence
- **Consistent behavior** across Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Platform-native APIs** for optimal performance
- **Unified file system handling** with proper permission preservation

### Security First
- **Path traversal protection** prevents malicious archives from writing outside target directories
- **Symlink escape detection** blocks attempts to create dangerous symbolic links
- **Zip bomb detection** identifies and rejects suspiciously high compression ratios

### User-friendly CLI
- **Clear, colored output** for better readability (with `NO_COLOR` support)
- **Progress display** shows extraction status in real-time
- **Helpful error messages** with suggestions for resolution
- **Short command aliases** for faster typing

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/itsakeyfut/zarc.git
cd zarc
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe

# Install (optional)
sudo cp zig-out/bin/zarc /usr/local/bin/
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Extract an archive
zarc extract archive.tar.gz

# Extract to a specific location
zarc extract archive.tar.gz -C /path/to/destination

# List contents
zarc list archive.tar.gz

# Detailed listing
zarc list archive.tar.gz -l

# Test integrity
zarc test archive.tar.gz
```

See our [design documentation](../DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md) for the complete roadmap.

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Pure Zig implementation** with zero external dependencies for core features
- **Memory-safe design** using Zig's allocator system
- **Streaming processing** for efficient memory usage
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with unit, integration, and compatibility tests

### Performance
- **Optimized I/O** with buffered reading and writing
- **Efficient decompression** with minimal memory overhead
- **Native system calls** for platform-specific operations

### Code Quality
- **Well-documented codebase** with inline documentation
- **Consistent coding standards** following Zig best practices
- **Extensive test suite** ensuring reliability
- **Cross-platform CI** validating builds on all supported platforms

## Known Limitations

This is an early release focused on establishing a solid foundation. Some features are not yet implemented:

- ❌ Archive creation (compress) - Planned for v0.2.0
- ❌ ZIP, 7z, bzip2, xz formats - Planned for future releases
- ❌ Encrypted archives - Planned for Phase 3
- ❌ Multi-volume archives - Under consideration

## Compatibility
